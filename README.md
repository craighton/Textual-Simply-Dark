# Textual-Simply-Dark
A Modified 'Simplified Dark' theme for Textual!
- - - -

I enjoyed the Simplified Dark theme for Textual but I found that some of the formatting wasn't up to scratch with what I like. So I made my own modifications to the CSS of the theme to replicate what I like to see when I'm chatting on IRC. I will provide a full changelog of all modifications that I make from the origional scene. I will take any issue reporting and will deal with issues on a case-by-case basis as I mostly made this theme for myself and am releasing it because there are likely people who want the same thing.
