## Introduction

The 'Simplified Dark' style from [Textual](https://github.com/Codeux-Software/Textual) is a great style, but it could be better.

It should be noted that 'Simplified Dark' is an already modified style of 'Simplified' which was origionally built for the Linkinus IRC client and then ported over to Textual. The majority of the code falls under the origional copyright of it's origional creator plus the supporting creator who brought it over to Textual and made the dark style.
